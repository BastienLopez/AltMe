## 1. altme


altme is a French company registered in Paris.


altme provides a self sovereign identity based on decentralized ledgers as a Blockchain public and private network.


Traditional architectures to validate, certify, and manage professional data are based on centralized, top-down approaches that rely on third-party private operators. Unfortunately these solutions often lead to inappropriate use of personal data and hacks.


altme approaches this issue starting from a user perspective through a Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) focused on professional data. altme allows Professional Identities for Talents, Companies and certificates issuers such as Schools or Training Centers.
It is for everyone the opportunity to use a new technology to get tamper proof professional data while keeping the ownership of that data.


Identities with their credentials can be displayed, if needed, anywhere on digital platforms : social media, websites, Job Boards, etc. They provide to third parties reliable data about professional experiences, skills and education.


This policy of privacy applies to the collection, use and disclosure of any personal information about users of our services.
